To get the application to run as a service \r\nyou will need to do the following:\r\n\r\n1.) Download or clone the source\r\n\r\n2.) Change the NugetCacheDirectory(this is the directory where NuGet stores the cached packages for your system) setting in the NugetCacheReplicatorService.exe.config and also change the TargetNugetRepositoryDirectory(this is the directory where you want your local cache to be) which is also in the NugetCacheReplicatorService.exe.config\r\n\r\n3.) XCopy the built Release files to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Nuget Cache Replicator\r\n\r\n4.) Open up CMD as an Administrator\r\n\r\n5.) Enter the command NugetCacheReplicatorService.exe install\r\n\r\n6.) Enter the command NugetCacheReplicatorService.exe start\r\n\r\n7.) Add this new folder as a Package Source in Visual Studio under Tools -> Options -> Package Manager -> Package Sources.\r\n\r\n8.) Chill as your new local NuGet cache is populated with NuGet Packages as you install them via the Package Manager\r\n\r\nHow to get hold of me\r\ntwitter: [@DeonHeyns](https://twitter.com/deonheyns)\r\n\r\nwebsite: [deonheyns.com](http://deonheyns.com/contact)\r\n\r\nGitHub: [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/deonheyns)\r\n\r\n#Open source projects used:\r\n\r\nTopshelf: https://github.com/phatboyg/Topshelf","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
